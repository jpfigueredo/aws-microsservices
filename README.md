# AWS Integration Portfolio with Java/Kotlin  

## Description  
This repository is dedicated to showcasing advanced skills in using AWS services through Java/Kotlin code. It features a microservices-based project that integrates several AWS services, demonstrating practical knowledge of cloud development, deployment, and testing.  

The primary goal is to provide a hands-on example of how AWS services can be effectively utilized in a real-world scenario using modern development practices.  

## Key AWS Services Used  
The project integrates the following AWS services:  
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing to execute code without managing servers.  
- **Amazon Redshift**: Data warehousing for analytics.  
- **Amazon SNS**: Publish/subscribe messaging service for communication between systems.  
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for decoupling and scaling applications.  
- **Amazon ECS**: Running containerized applications at scale.  
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational database service.  
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability for AWS applications.  
- **Amazon Kinesis**: Streaming data for real-time analytics.  
- **AWS CodeCommit**: Git-based version control for source code management.  
- **Amazon ECR**: Container image repository for Docker and OCI images.  
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for scalable file storage and retrieval.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for fast and scalable data storage.  

## Technologies and Tools  
- **Programming Languages**: Java, Kotlin  
- **Framework**: Spring (Spring Boot, Spring Cloud)  
- **Testing Tools**: JUnit, TestContainers, and AWS SDK Mocking  
- **AWS CLI V2**: For AWS service configuration and deployment  
- **Docker**: Containerization of microservices  

## Features  
- Implementation of a microservices architecture with each service integrated into specific business functionalities.  
- Real-world examples of how to utilize AWS services to solve business challenges.  
- Comprehensive testing of AWS services for robust and reliable applications.  
- Demonstration of best practices in cloud application design and development.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
1. AWS CLI V2 installed and configured ([Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)).  
2. Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher installed.  
3. Docker installed for containerization ([Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)).  
4. AWS IAM credentials with permissions for the listed AWS services.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-microservices-portfolio.git  
   cd aws-microservices-portfolio
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven or Gradle:
  ```bash
  # For Maven  
  mvn clean install  
  # For Gradle  
  ./gradlew build  
  ```
3. Run the services:
- Use Docker Compose for local deployment.
  ```bash
  docker-compose up  
  ```
- Deploy to AWS ECS for a production-like environment.

## Testing
The repository includes unit and integration tests for each AWS service integration. Run the tests with:

  ```bash
  # For Maven  
  mvn test  
  # For Gradle  
  ./gradlew test  
  ```
